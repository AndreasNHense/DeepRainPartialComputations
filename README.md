The multiple correlation and/or regression information that two competing forecast systems have on
the same observations is decomposed into four components, adapting the method of multivariate information
decomposition of Williams and Beer (2010), Wibral et al. (2015), and Lizier et al. (2018). Their concept is to
divide source information about a target into total, (target) redundant or shared, and unique information from
each source. It is applied here to the comparison of forecast systems using classic regression. Additionally, nontarget
redundant or shared information is newly defined that resumes the redundant information of the forecasts
which is not observed. This provides views that go beyond classic correlation differences. These five terms share
the same units and can be directly compared to put prediction results into perspective. The redundance terms in
particular provide a new view. All components are given as maps of explained variance on the observations and
for the non-target redundance on the models, respectively. Exerting this concept to lagged damped persistence
is shown to be related to directed information entropy. To emphasize the benefit of the toolkit on all timescales,
two analysis examples are provided. Firstly, two forecast systems of the German decadal prediction system
of “Mittelfristige Klimaprognose”, namely the pre-operational version and a special version using ensemble
Kalman filter for the ocean initialization, are compared. The analyses reveal the clear added value of the latter
and provide an as yet unseen map of their non-target redundance.
